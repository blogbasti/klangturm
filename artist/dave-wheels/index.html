F Major is often referred to as the ‘happiest’ musical key and the F Major 7th chord uses the notes F, A, C and E: letters that are also found in the clock FACE. - I have also chosen to highlight common stages of the day: When the day has begun, when it is ending (the time for replenishment), the traditional midday announcement that ‘all is well’, and a closing sound to signal the gateway to our relaxation and dreams. Within this framework, gentle hourly markers are accompanied by subtle references to Immanuelkirche itself and also to a ‘master’ number that symbolises spiritual awakening, enlightenment, inspiration and new beginnings.”]" />
